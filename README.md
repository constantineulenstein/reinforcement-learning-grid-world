# reinforcement-learning-grid-world

## Description:

This project contains the implementation of a grid world, in which an agent is supposed to develop a policy that leads it on the fastest way to the goal state. The environment is stochastic and consists of walls as well as a penalty and a goal state. I implemented both policy evaluation and iteration (dynamic programming) and Monte-Carlo and Sarsa to solve the task.


## Folder structure:
The uploaded project consists of a python file that runs the entire script ranging from the implementation of individual algorithms up to their evaluation compared to each other. Additionally, a notebook is included that lets the user run algorithms seperately as well as various evaluations. The task was setin the file task.pdf and my solutions are reported in report.pdf.

## Requirements
IML_DecisionTree requires the following to run: 
* ```Python3```
* ```numpy ```
* ```matplotlib```

## Run instructions:

* This project can be run via the command line using the command ```python3 grid_world.py``` . 
    * The code then builds the environment and runs all algorithms including evaluation. The results of the evaluations will be both printed and saved in form of pngs. 
* To print individual parts of the code use the notebook and run the individual cells
